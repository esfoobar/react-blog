# React Blog

This is a hack day project where I will try to setup a core React/Express/MongoDB blogging application.

I am borrowing ideas from the [the official React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) and from this [Scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-real-time-twitter-stream-with-node-and-react-js).
