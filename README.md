# React Blog

This is a hack day project where I will try to setup a core React/Express/MongoDB blogging application.

I am borrowing ideas from the [the official React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) and from this [Scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-real-time-twitter-stream-with-node-and-react-js).

## Development process

- First I will create a public/ folder where the static files will live.
- Then I will start a node setup with ```npm init -y```.
- Install express ```npm install --save express``` and create a server.js
- Install ```npm install --save-dev nodemon``` to watch for file changes and then execute using ```npm run dev```

- Create a ```views/layouts/main.handlebars``` template folder
